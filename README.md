# project: to-the-moon
# What and Why
the idea of 'to-the-moon' is inspired by an adventure game about two doctors traversing backwards through a dying man's memories to artificially fulfill his last wish. The game gradully unfold itself by connecting menmory fragments with photos that range from decades. This is a really delicated and emotion-provoking game, which led me pondering over the question: how to arrange our memories? 
I hardly believe in human brain capacity of memorizing everything, hence to-the-moon, a web-based app where one could upload photo-based records to the server and the cloud,so that one could arrange them and retreive them whenever you want. It could be a private tree hole, where one could put anything inside; or it could be a great place to generate one's profile with every little thing that had done.

# For whom
to-the-moon is more like a private instagram, but more to the purpose of memory-management other than social. It's for those who believe in digital memories better than human brain, and for those who feel the desire to have a more clear picture of oneself by putting together the past dots (and probably gain something from sorting out the past)

# Format and How
First of all, to-the-moon will have several journey path, with each of them with different prompts, leading to different endings. For example, there will be 'high school journey', 'everything-about-my-first-time', or 'something I will never tell my mom', etc. Within each album, there will be different prompt to guide user to use the album as a templet to record their life; and surely, users could have the flexibility to design their own templet (and probably there could be a community for sharing templets, if not sharing the actual contents)
  Must-have features:
  * users' homepage and profile
  * uploading and arrange photos to user homepage and album, with properly disgned UI
  * built-in templet and prompt, with interaction with users as guidance 
  * adjusting, making comments, writing text notes within each album 
  * sharing templet and/or album (exporting the whole journey as a long pic or video for sharing)
# Scope
this app needs to have access to cloud where large amount of photo could stored

(The app should be appropriate for this semester-base course)
